## Pylint errors {#pylint}

### R0101: Too many nested blocks {#R0101}

This error occurs when you have more than three nested blocks in your code.
This type of nesting is a sign that your function is too complex,
and should be broken down using helper functions.

Note: the nested block doesn't doesn't include function or class definition
as a block, so the example below is considered to have *four* nested blocks,
not five.

```python
def my_f(num):
    if num > 0:
        if num > 3:
            if num > 10:
                if num < 50:
                    print(num)
    else:
        print('done')
```

### R0102: Simplifiable if statement {#R0102}

This error occurs when you have an if statement that can be simplified
simply by using the value of the condition, rather than putting in extra
`True` and `False` literals.

```python
def is_even(num):
    """Return whether <num> is even or odd."""
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

The above example can be simplified to:

```python
def is_even(num):
    """Return whether <num> is even or odd."""
    return num % 2 == 0
```


### C0111: Missing docstring {#C0111}

This is some helpful description of the C0111 error.

## Custom errors {#custom}

### E9999: Forbidden imports {#E9999}

For your work in CSC148, we expect you to use only the Python language
features we have covered in lectures, or ones that we have explicitly
mentioned for an exercise/lab/assignment. If you are getting this error,
please check your code carefully.

```python
import copy   # Error on this line

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = copy.copy(x)
```
